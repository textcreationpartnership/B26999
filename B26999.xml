            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Wherefore <hi>John</hi> takes up the same matter, and handles it more fully, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. as <hi>Daniel</hi> had done, Chap. 7. discovering those other things to be wrapt up in it, though not particula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized; and therefore taketh occasion to mention the ten horns (according to <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.7.) in <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.1. For the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of which, consider, as <hi>Daniel</hi> (the Babylonish Monarchy being ended, <hi>Dan.</hi> 5.31.) begins, Chap. 8. at the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Persians:</hi> so doth <hi>John</hi> in his 13 Chap. for his seven heads, it answering directly thereunto: As for instance,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Ram, <hi>Dan.</hi> 8.3. which was the <hi>Mede</hi> and <hi>Persian,</hi> vers. 28. was one head.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The great horn of the he-Goat, <hi>Dan.</hi> 8.5. which was the first of the <hi>Grecian,</hi> vers. 21. is the second.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The four notable horns, <hi>Dan.</hi> 8.8. being the other four heads of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Monarchy, <hi>Dan.</hi> 8.22. makes six.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The little horn which comes out of them, <hi>Dan.</hi> 8.9. which was to be a fierce king, <hi>Dan.</hi> 8.22. and a wonderful, battering, breaking, and destroying king, <hi>Dan.</hi> 8.24. which was the <hi>Romane</hi> Monarchy, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2.40. and 7.23. makes the seventh: which are the seven heads, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.1.</p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:206758:5"/>
                  <p>Now as to the ten horns, this seventh head being the fourth Beast, or <hi>Romane</hi> Monarchy, as you see, the ten horns do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly belong unto it, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.7. though <hi>Dan.</hi> chap. 8. doth not particularize them, as in his 7, and <hi>John</hi> in his 13.</p>
                  <p>Among or after which ten horns, there is another little horn, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.8. or Beast, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.11. or kinde of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment diverse from the former, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.24.) to arise; though <hi>Dan.</hi> chap. 8. doth not particularize. Which little horn, as he is to <hi>make war against the Saints,</hi> Dan. 7.21. so he is also to <hi>exercise all the power of the first Beast</hi> (and that considered as <hi>John</hi> hath considered him, in the whole race of the whole Monarchies, from the <hi>Babylonish</hi>) against them, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.1, 12.</p>

(so much despised and contemned at this day:) Considering, I say, all these things, I judge it our duties to teach and admonish one another, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.13. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.16. (<hi>and so much the more, as we see the day approaching,</hi> Heb. 10.25.) and to lift up our voices like trumpets, to tell <hi>England</hi> of their sins, and their Law-givers of their transgressions.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Considering your Arguments whereby you maintain the safeness of this Law of God, pag. 19, 20. and the which I would fain see what Lawyer in <hi>England, Scotland, Ireland,</hi> or elsewhere, is able to contradict. And considering whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (as you say) the want thereof hath not been the ruine of all the States and Governments in the four Monarchies hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto: And whether it will not as surely be of this, I doubt not but we shall cease to strive, and rather finde out one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other to joyn hand in hand in this glorious (though despised) Cause and interest of Jesus Christ: in which that we may be one, not in part, but in whole, let us in love weigh and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, without haste or prejudice,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Whether the business of <hi>Charles,</hi> which you say was the first deadly wound to Monarchy, Prerogative Royal, (or Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gislativeship) was not to be healed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Whether after the wound, the Image of that Beast were not to be made.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Whether at this day the wound be not healed, and the Image set up. Which if it be, let us not ask, <hi>What shall we cry?</hi> our work is before us.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Whether the Little horn be not now upon his feet, and that the Lord Protector so called is not he. Which if he be also, to set our face against his face, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 3.8. and tell him so.</p>
               <p>In the examining of which, I judge it requisite first to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish this Little horn from the ten, and to prove him ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:206758:8"/> as well in number as form; contra. p. 3, 13, 15. of your book: which I shall prosecute with the ten following Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In that <hi>Daniel</hi> saw ten horns upon the head of the Beast, before that little horn, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.7. that is therefore an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Because <hi>Daniel</hi> saw not the springing up of the ten, which he did of that, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.8. therefore another.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Inasmuch as the holy Ghost calls it so, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.8. there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. It came up amongst them, <hi>viz.</hi> the ten: so that there were ten before this came up, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.8. therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. The priority you seem to hint at, relating indeed (as you say) to <hi>Charles,</hi> or the three kingdoms which were to be pluck'd up (before him, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.8.) <hi>viz.</hi> the Little horn; not to him, he arising after them, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.24. If that by priority be understood (which, as you see, agrees with Scripture) their being pluckt up by the roots, before the Little horn become: the horn (or takes the Legislative power) of those kingdoms, it cannot be <hi>Charles,</hi> but another, and that in number as well as form.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quer.</hi> But you may say, <hi>How was it among them, and yet after them? (and how was it a horn, before it had the Legislative power?) This is contradiction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> First, no more contradiction then the holy Ghost (which speaketh no contradiction) hath spoken, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.8, 24.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it is no contradiction, if you consider when he is called the Little horn, (since it was then, that it was among them:) for it did not always remain a little horn, though it was the same horn: therefore must he be considered two ways:</p>
               <p>First, as a Little horn, <hi>viz.</hi> King<note n="*" place="margin">The etymologie of the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Saxon word <hi>Cu-ning,</hi> (now in English, <hi>King</hi>) is as much as to say. <hi>One especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly valiant.</hi> Vide Hist. <hi>Verst.</hi>
                  </note>, Captain, Head, or chief Governour (which is all one, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10.1, 19. and 15.17. 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.22. (of an Army: in which estate he rises a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, and subdues, and pulls up three by the roots.</p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:206758:8"/>
               <p>Secondly, not as a little horn, but as equal with any of the rest, when he is made the horn (King, Captain, Supreme Head or Governour, which is all one) of the three Nations subdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and pluck'd up: and this he is to be after the former; at which time he is not called a <hi>Little horn,</hi> but the phrase being <hi>ten,</hi> and <hi>another,</hi> Dan. 7.24. So that thus considered, it is no strange thing for him to arise among them, and also after them.</p>
               <p>That for a Little horn to enlarge its commanding power, is to be greater, see the Little horn that waxt <hi>exceeding great, Dan.</hi> 8.9. which I have prov'd the Romane Monarchy, in my former Treatise of the two Little horns; which indeed had its birth somthing like this, 1 <hi>Mach.</hi> 1. and therefore with this (all being wrapt up in one, as that great mystery sheweth) is fitly termed <hi>The evening and the morning,</hi> Dan. 8.26.</p>
               <p n="6">6. You say <hi>Charles</hi> (in whom the three Kings were pluck'd up) was the first that God brought to judgement by dismem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring, or beheading, (or a wound by a sword) p. 56. which wound being again to be healed, as I shall after prove, and the wound of the Little horn is not, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.26, 27. it is not <hi>Charles,</hi> but another in number as well as form.</p>
               <p n="7">7. You say, At that time (<hi>viz.</hi> the time of judging the Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle horn) the Legislative power shall be onely in the hand of Christ himself, p. 14. But it is not so now, unless the Lord Protector so called be he, and <hi>Whitehal</hi> his throne; which they are not, seeing the Legislative power is in his hand: <hi>Gov.</hi> Art. 1. therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. As you say, <hi>Charles</hi> had a designe against the Saints of God, and would have destroyed them, p. 28, 29. But the Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle horn, in his having a designe against them, is not said one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to <hi>will</hi> their destruction, but to <hi>prevail against them,</hi> Dan. 7.21, 25. which, blessed be the Lord, <hi>Charles</hi> did not: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9. Considering he that subdues the three Kings is the Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle horn, and, as it is well observed, (<hi>Dan.</hi> 7.17, 23. holding forth as much) that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>
                  </gap> is to be indifferently understood for <hi>Kings</hi> or <hi>Kingdoms,</hi> the word as you say including both,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:206758:9"/> p. 15. we should, in taking <hi>Charles</hi> to be the subduer of the three kingdoms, make him to be the subduer of himself; which he was not, but another: therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">10. You say, (and expected had been done) The emblems, or (if you will) the figures and representations of the Kingly prerogative of the Little horn, shall from thence begin to be utterly destroyed. But if there be now a new Image of the same, as <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.14. you will I hope shake hands, and say with me, (like Christ our Captain) not fearing men, <hi>This day is the Scripture fulfilled in our ears,</hi> Luk. 4.21.

               <p>Having thus distinguis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>'d the Little horn, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.8. let us fall upon my first-proposed four Considerations, and first exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine whether or no the business of <hi>Charles,</hi> which as you say was the first deadly wound to Monar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â¢</desc>
                  </gap>hy, Prerogative Royal, or Legislativeship, was not to be healed: which I conceive it was, for these five following Reasons.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Because another must follow it, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.24. <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.11.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Because he must, as the former, be an opposer of the Saints, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.20.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Because he must be stouter then his fellows, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.20.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Because he must exercise all the power of the former, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.12.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Because the Scripture doth in plain terms affirm it, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.3, 12. therefore that deadly wound to Monarchy, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative Royal, or Legislativeship, was to be healed.</p>
               <p>Secondly, let us examine whether or no, after the wound, the Image of that Beast was not to be made: which I also conceive it was, for these three following Reasons.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Because he that hath so formerly wounded that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, may be ashamed to set up the very same: neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, since he is to be as afore-mentioned, he must be like it, yet diverse from it, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.24. which is <hi>the image of.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:206758:9"/>2. Because as many as will not worship the Image, shall be killed, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.15.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Because <hi>John (Rev.</hi> 13.14.) doth positively affirm it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, let us examine if the wound be not healed: which I conceive it is, for these four following Reasons.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Because that which our great boast stood in the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val of, p. 17, 18. <hi>viz.</hi> the taking away of all Sultanship, form or figure of Prerogative Royal, or Legislativeship, which you say is the Soveraign power, p. 14. and onely to be in the hand of Christ, is at this day assumed by men.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Because it is also established and confirmed, and that upon one man.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Because he hath both received it, and owned it. <hi>Vide Govern.</hi> and <hi>Oath</hi> thereunto annexed.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Because it is est<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â¢</desc>
                  </gap>emed mans treason, albeit Gods truth, to gainsay it; as the following Considerations will clearly prove it.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, whether or no the Little horn be not at this day upon his feet: which I also conceive he is, for these eight fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Reasons.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Because there is now a different Government; when you, and I, and a cloud of witnesses (among the rest, the Army and now-Lord Protector so called, in Declaration to <hi>Scotland,</hi> p. 38.) according to the sense and s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â¢</desc>
                  </gap>ope of Scripture do conclude, that <hi>Charles</hi> (in whom the three Kings or King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms were plucked up) was of the ten horns.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Because he that was next to follow, was to be he, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.24.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Because a Little horn, (<hi>viz.</hi> the Head, Chief Captain, or Governour of a company of men, not a whole Nation, much less three) did pluck them up.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Because that Little horn doth now succeed in the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gislativeship or Power: which though men call Treason, I must, in the name of the Lord Jesus, who is <hi>King of kings, and Lord of lords,</hi> (my Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>â¢â¢</desc>
                  </gap>er) bear testimony against, (because 'tis sin) which shall be barely in the words of the text, <hi>Isai.</hi> 33.22. <hi>The LORD is my law-giver.</hi> And as there
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:206758:10"/> is but one, (I own no other) <hi>James</hi> 4.12.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Because he is more stout then the former, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.20.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Because he is an opposer of the Sains, (witness <hi>Feake, Rogers,</hi> &amp;c.) <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.20.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Because but an Image of <hi>Charles</hi> is at this day set up: for e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â¢</desc>
                  </gap>ery one to his face dares say he is no King; which I am sure he is more like, then any Image that ever I saw before him. <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.14.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Because it is accounted treason to oppose this Image, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.15.</p>
               <p>For which Reasons,</p>
               <p>I conceive you were mistaken, (and that you your self will see it) in judging <hi>Charles</hi> to be the Little horn, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. and that <hi>Oliver</hi> Lord Protector, so called, is he in whom whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Scripture makes mention of concerning the Little horn, shall be accomplished. In the mean time, let the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Characters of him satisfie for the first eight months of his Legislativeship.</p>
               <p>But <hi>wo, wo, wo;</hi> the worst followeth.</p>
               <p>Wherefore hear the sound of the Trumpet, O ye people: <hi>As is the morning, so is the evening</hi> of <hi>Dan.</hi> 8.26. For <hi>the time is come,</hi> (again) <hi>that judgement must begin at the house of God:</hi> (by <hi>such a day of trouble, as never was since there was a nation, Dan.</hi> 12.1. wherein <hi>two parts must be cut off, and the third part go thorow the fire,</hi> Zech. 13.8, 9.) <hi>But if it first begin at us, what shall be the end of them that obey not</hi> the Commandments of God? <hi>and if the righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly and sinners appear?</hi> 1 Pet. 4.17, 18. For <hi>the day hastens after, that burns like an oven: and the wicked shall be burnt up; there shall not of them all be left one</hi> (sprig or) <hi>branch,</hi> Mal. 4.6. But then shall that <hi>third part,</hi> that hath endured the fire, in the zeal of God, trample down the wicked (and the great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulting Kings, Nobles, and Potentates of the earth) like ashes under their feet, <hi>binding them in iron chains, and fetters,</hi> Psal. 149.8. Wherefore, though the time be at hand, that <hi>the powers of the heavens shall be shaken, and mens hearts shall fail

Ezek. 3.8, 9. Joh. 14.17. For <hi>the fearful shall have their portion in the lake that burns with brimstone,</hi> Rev. 21.8. Therefore be ye valiant and couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; and <hi>though bonds and afflictions wait for you,</hi> yet <hi>let no such thing trouble you,</hi> Acts 20.23, 24. but whilst you <hi>suffer according to the will of God, commit the keeping of your souls to him in well-doing,</hi> 1 Pet. 4.19. setting your faces against their faces; bearing testimony to <hi>the truth as it is in Jesus; not lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving your lives unto the death:</hi> So shall you <hi>fight the good fight, keep the faith,</hi> and <hi>finish your course with joy,</hi> and <hi>receive a crown of life and glory, which God the righteous Judge shall give unto you.</hi> 2 Tim. 4.7. Acts 20.24.</p>
               <p>But <hi>as many as worship the beast and his image, shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture into the cup of his indignation: and they shall be tormented with fire and brimstone, in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb.</hi> Rev. 14.9, 10.</p>
